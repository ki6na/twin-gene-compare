# twin-gene-compare
Our names are Diana and Kiana. We are identical twins and this is the code that we used to analyze our data from 23andMe to figure out how identical we actually are! We used the raw data report of about 640,000 SNPs to figure out how similar our genomes are. The datasets are not included here for privacy purposes.
